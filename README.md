## 🛠️ Method Overview

<p align="center">
    <img src="./figures/Overview.png" alt="Overview" />
</p>


Pixel-level segmentation of structural cracks across various scenarios remains a considerable challenge. Current methods encounter challenges in effectively modeling crack morphology and texture, facing challenges in balancing segmentation quality with low computational resource usage. To overcome these limitations, we propose a lightweight Structure-Aware Vision Mamba Network (**SCSegamba**), capable of generating high-quality pixel-level segmentation maps by leveraging both the morphological information and texture cues of crack pixels with minimal computational cost. Specifically, we developed a **S**tructure-**A**ware **V**isual **S**tate Space module (**SAVSS**), which incorporates a lightweight **G**ated **B**ottleneck **C**onvolution (**GBC**) and a **S**tructure-**A**ware **S**canning **S**trategy (**SASS**). The key insight of GBC lies in its effectiveness in modeling the morphological information of cracks, while the SASS enhances the perception of crack topology and texture by strengthening the continuity of semantic information between crack pixels. Experiments on crack benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving the highest performance with only 2.8M parameters. On the multi-scenario dataset, our method reached 0.8390 in F1 score and 0.8479 in mIoU.

## 🕹Getting Started

#### Environment Setup

You can create your own conda environment for SCSegamba based on the following command⚙️:

```shell
conda create -n SCSegamba python=3.10 -y
conda activate SCSegamba
pip install torch==1.13.1+cu116 torchvision==0.14.1+cu116 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install -U openmim
mim install mmcv-full
pip install mamba-ssm==1.2.0
pip install timm lmdb mmengine numpy
```

#### Run

You can modify the parameters in the **main.py** file and run it with the following command (The structure of the dataset folder is set to be consistent with the [TUT](https://github.com/Karl1109/TUT)):

``````shell
python main.py
``````

You can also use checkpoints for inference with the following command:

```shell
python test.py
```

Use the following commands to calculate metrics (You can find the SCSegamba test results on the TUT dataset in the `./results/results_test/TUT_results/` path and calculate the metrics using the following command.):

```shell
python eval_compute.py
cd eval
python evaluate.py
```

You can also follow the steps below to validate the results of our experiments on the TUT dataset.

- **Download Checkpoint**: Get the [checkpoint_TUT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aK7DgtZlyij88zbdBVf8XahfHdKbMQwK/view?usp=drive_link) file we pre-trained on the TUT dataset.

- **File Placement**: Move the downloaded checkpoint file to the designated path: `./checkpoints/weights/checkpoint_TUT/`

- **Run**: Change the relevant path in test.py and run this command: `python test.py`.

#### The dataset division, checkpoints and inference results of SCSegamba when processing on Crack500, DeepCrack and CrackMap have been made available on [Resources_released](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sZttku4AVH8CiyJQUnHnT3innBeU-9HS/view?usp=sharing).

## 🔭Visualization

Visual comparison of typical cracks with 9 methods across four datasets. Red boxes highlight critical details, and green boxes mark misidentified regions:

We also deployed SCSegamba checkpoint files trained on four publicly available datasets **on real videos**, and the visualization video demonstrates that our SCSegamba achieves the best segmentation results on unknown video data:
